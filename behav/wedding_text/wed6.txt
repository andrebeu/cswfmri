0 -- Today Bob and Jennifer are getting married. They used to dance competitively together as partners, and started dating once they had won the World Latin Dance Cup. 

1 -- The officiant of the wedding welcomes them and their guests: ‘Welcome and thank you for joining us on this special day!’

2 -- First, Bob and Jennifer celebrate this day with a campfire. This ritual symbolizes their undying love. The heat reminds them of their dancing, especially when they are doing the tango.

3 -- Bob and Jennifer start their wedding rituals with the planting of a flower to symbolize a new start together. Jennifer gets the flower and they plant it together. They picked this flower because Jennifer used to wear it in her hair when she danced. 

4 -- The next ritual they perform is dropping a valuable item into a bowl. This symbolizes that they appreciate their friends for coming to celebrate their wedding. 

5 -- The officiant now performs a ritual to symbolize the union of Bob and Jennifer. She does this by circling Bob and Jennifer while Bob holds a lighted torch.

6 -- The last ritual involves an egg. Jennifer brings the egg. They chose to put maracas on their egg, because it reminds them of how they love to dance to live music. Together they break the egg, to symbolize that there are no obstacles to their love. 

7 -- Bob and Jennifer now get the chance to make a painting as a nice memory of this day of wedding rituals. They decided to paint their two pet ducks, who safely live in their backyard pond when Bob and Jennifer go to dance competitions. 

8 -- They are very happy with their gifts! They received an Egyptian statue, to put in their house, and a book on the history of dance!
