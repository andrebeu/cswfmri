0 -- After 3 years of dating, Jolene and Jeffrey are getting married. They met in Ireland 3 years ago, when they were both backpacking around Europe. They enjoyed each other’s company so much, they decided to combine their trips and backpack together. Today is their wedding.  

1 -- The officiant of the wedding welcomes them and their guests: “Welcome everyone. We are pleased to gather today for the union of this beloved couple, Jolene and Jeffrey.”

2 -- To start the ceremony, Jolene and Jeffrey build a campfire. They gather around the flames and this is meant to symbolize their eternal love. This reminds the couple of when they were backpacking in Spain, and there was a parade with fire and a bonfire at the end. 

3 -- To start the ceremony, they plant a flower to symbolize how they have begun a new life together. They plant a Black-Eyed Susan, a plant native to Ireland, in honor of where they first met. 

4 -- The next ritual they perform is the dropping of coins into a bowl to show appreciation for the community for supporting them. 

5 -- The officiant will now perform a ritual that will symbolize the union of Jolene and Jeffrey. She encircles them while Jeffrey holds a lighted torch. 

6 -- The last ritual involves an egg. Jennifer brings the egg and together they break it. This symbolizes the destruction of evil within them, before they start their lives together. They drew a potato on their egg, because in Ireland that was the food they always ate together on dates in Ireland. 

7 -- Jolene and Jeffrey now create a painting to always remind them of this day. They paint their two best friends, who had introduced them in Ireland.

8 -- They are grateful to see that their friends gave them gifts! They received a suitcase, so that they can travel back to Ireland one day, and hopefully show their future kids, where they fell in love. They also received a bear decorative plaque, as inspiration for them to travel to the smoky mountains too!
