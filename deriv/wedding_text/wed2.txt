1 -- The officiant of the wedding greets them and their guests: “Welcome! What a beautiful day to be celebrating the marriage of Beth and Jim.”

2 -- First, Beth and Jim gather around the campfire to commemorate their love. The flame reminds them of the bonfire the last night of the retreat, when they held hands for the first time. 

3 -- First, Beth and Jim come together to plant a flower to symbolize that they are entering a new chapter of life together. Jim and Beth plant a lotus, which symbolizes enlightenment in the buddhist tradition. 

4 -- Next, they drop coins into a bowl to show gratitude for having met, and for being able to spend their lives together. 

5 -- Next, the officiant encircles them while Jim holds a lighted torch, to symbolize the union of Beth and Jim. 

6 -- In the last ritual, Beth brings out egg and together Beth and Jim break it, to symbolize the destruction of evil within them before they start their lives together. They drew a hot air balloon on their egg, because after the Buddhist retreat, 6 months later, Jim proposed to Beth on a hot air balloon ride. 

7 -- Now in the last ritual, Beth and Jim create a painting to commemorate this day. They paint a picture of a Buddha, because that is who they wish to emulate. 

8 -- The ceremony ends with gratitude for the gifts! They received a doll, for their future child, if it is a girl, and they received a toy boat, if it is a boy. Beth and Jim are very happy.
